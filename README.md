# SceneRecognition

This repository includes all results, training curves, and information related to our experiments on CNNs using transfer learning to try to solve the scene recognition problem

4 types of CNNs were trained (InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16) comparing 2 methods of training on each type (Transfer Learning and From Scratch)

## Structure

### CSVs

This folder contains CSV files describing in detail all the training processes and loss and accuracy changes for each epoch of each CNN

### Plots

Containing training curves for all experiments
